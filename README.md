Rock Paper Scissors game made in JavaScript. First JS project as part of The Odin Project.

Created a basic UI with 3 buttons to allow user to select which move they wanted to use. Game results and info to player is output into a div. 

I learned how to use JavaScript to write basic functions, control html elements, apply css styling to elements, write DOM methods to make text appear on the screen in response to an event (e.g. button click), and disable buttons once the game is over to prevent user from playing.

I think the way I set up the DOM methods was very tedious and probably not the most elegant solution. Maybe I will learn more efficient ways to handle this as I get more experience with JavaScript.
